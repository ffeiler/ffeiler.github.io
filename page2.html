    <p class="content">Life finds a way. This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows. So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager? Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine?
    </p>
    <p class="content">Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance. What do they got in there? King Kong? Must go faster.
    </p>
    <p class="content">Just my luck, no ice. Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! I was part of something special. God help us, we're in the hands of engineers.
    </p>
    <p class="content">This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows. You really think you can fly that thing? So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard!
